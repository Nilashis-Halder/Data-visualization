Here are a few interactive dashboards and reports made with Excel and MS Power BI & Tableau tools.

## Excel dashboards:
 - ### [Interactive excel dashboard (sales data)](https://github.com/Nilashis-Halder/Data-visualization/blob/1c3879558dcfb9c7ddf155b3aadd9d76217c4198/Interactive%20excel%20dashboard%20(sales%20data).xlsx)
   - #### ðŸ› Building Interactive Excel Dashboard to report relevant of Sales and Employee performance indexes using a sample sales data set from [excelfind.com](https://excelfind.com/downloads/#/).
   - #### ðŸš€Steps:
     1) Created pivot tables with the whole sales data set to model the data so its easier to accurately create charts like - Line chart, Bar chart, Column chart, Map chart, Doughnut chart
     etc. visualizing different types of sales & performance metrics.
     2) Since excel doesn't currently support Map chart directly from pivot table, as a way around, a dynamic copy of the relevant pivot table was created outside the 
     pivot table which was referenced to create the map chart.
     3) Added Slicers for every dimension that we want to filter in and connected all slicers to every chart to make them interactive and cross-dimensionally filterable.
